The workflow is generally as below
Servername input -> Username, password input (loop until connected, max 3 times) -> Retrieve Performance Data -> Display Summary Report -> Exit 

###############
Details:

*** Servername input:
use the Test-ServerAvailability function in the LowFreeSpace script, prioritize WinRM connectivity only (since it's required for actual operations). Keep ping as optional diagnostic data.

*** Username, password input
use the Get-Session function in the LowFreeSpace script, loop until connected, max 3 times

*** Retrieve Performance Data
- Uptime: new function Get-SystemUptime: Input(server name, remote session), Output (uptime, servername with $env:COMPUTERNAME) (Retrieves the server’s uptime, showing how long it has been running since the last reboot.)
- Get-PerformanceMetrics: Input (server name, remote session, number of samples, sample interval in second) Monitors the server over a specified duration (collecting x samples every y seconds) to gather:
    Average overall CPU usage percentage.
    Average overall memory usage percentage.
    Per-process data, including average CPU consumption, memory consumption, PID, and the user running each process.
- Get-TopCPUProcesses: Input(raw process data from Get-PerformanceMetrics) analyze the data from Get-PerformanceMetrics, sorts it by average CPU consumption, and identifies the top 5 processes.
- Get-TopMemoryProcesses: Input(raw process data from Get-PerformanceMetrics). Analyzes the process data from Get-PerformanceMetrics, sorts it by average memory consumption, and identifies the top 5 processes.

*** Dashboard Display
- Show-PerformanceDashboard: Input(Uptime from Get-SystemUptime, Top processes (CPU+RAM) from Get-TopCPUProcesses, Get-TopMemoryProcesses)
